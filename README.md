This repository is a collection of Machine Learning, AI, and Data Science projects.
The goal is to practice, experiment, and continuously improve models while using GitHub for version control and project tracking.

Each project demonstrates different aspects of the ML workflow — from data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation to deployment-ready pipelines.

🚀 Features

End-to-end ML projects with clean and modular code

Continuous uploads (new projects, improvements, experiments)

Version control with Git & GitHub

Covers both classical ML and Deep Learning

Notebooks, datasets, and results included for reproducibility
